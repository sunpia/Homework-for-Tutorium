3)Functional Testing
	Functional testing is a type of black-box testing. It is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements.

4)End-to-end Testing
	End-to-end testing is a methodology used to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish. The purpose of carrying out end-to-end tests is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the right information is passed between various system components and systems.	

5)Performance Testing
	Performance Testing is defined as a type of software testing to ensure software applications will perform well under their expected workload.

6)Usability Testing
	Usability testing is a way to see how easy to use something is by testing it with real users.

7)Acceptance Testing
	acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met. It may involve chemical tests, physical tests, or performance tests.

8)Beta Testing
	In software development, a beta test is the second phase of software testing in which a sampling of the intended audience tries the product out.

some other type of testing
a)System Testing
	System testing tests a completely integrated system to verify that the system meets its requirements.

b)Installation Testing
