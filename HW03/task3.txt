a)What is the size of variable p on Euler?
	The size of p is 12*4=48 bit.

b)What is the address of p?
	0x7fffffffd6a8	

c)What is the address of c?
	0x7fffffffd6a7

d)What is the value of arr[0] after the assignment on line 16?
	10

e)What is the value of arr[0] at the end of the program?
	266

f)Explain why the value of arr[0] changes
	Before line 16 the value of arr[0] is 0x0000000a(10), because of the length of char is 1 byte and int is 4 byte so the code on line 16 only change the value of arr[0] to 0x0000010a(266)(the order of data in memory is inverse).
